## Project description 

_My Fun Run_ is an Android virtual themed race app with a cloud service which allows you to store 
that data from races. Users can track and save their routes while utilizing themed race mode options
 to simulate real life themed runs. This ultra-immersive running game will get any user motivated to 
 get running and achieve their goals.
 
During registration a user will be asked to select their desired skill level: beginner, intermediate, or advanced. After registration when 
the user logs in they will select a race, along with an optional theme or event. Users will be able to track their distance, time, and pace for
 each run. This saved data can be used to track their daily, weekly,and monthly progress. These 
 stats can also be used to compete against other users of the app. Their stats will be
 grouped according to skill level, and will be ranked on the distance they ran and their time. This will
 create ranking for users to see where they stand against other app users. Also, runners can choose 
 to comment on other user's runs providing further encouragement. Runners will repeat this process
 for each run they complete and choose to publish for others ranking and others to view. Users can
 choose not to publish run stats and save for private viewing and personal tracking purposes.
